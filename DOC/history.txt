Sources history of the 7-Zip
----------------------------

9.18           2010-11-02
-------------------------	
- New small SFX module for installers (C/Util/SfxSetup).


9.17           2010-10-04
-------------------------
- IStream.h::IOutStream::
    STDMETHOD(SetSize)(Int64 newSize) PURE;
  was changed to
    STDMETHOD(SetSize)(UInt64 newSize) PURE;


9.09           2009-12-12
-------------------------
- The bug was fixed:
   Utf16_To_Utf8 funstions in UTFConvert.cpp and 7zMain.c
   incorrectly converted surrogate characters (the code >= 0x10000) to UTF-8.


9.05           2009-07-05
-------------------------
- FileMapping.h::CFileMapping now returns WRes


9.04           2009-05-30
-------------------------
- ICoder.h: NCoderPropID::EEnum values were changed


9.02           2009-04-23
-------------------------
- Bug was fixed: if swap2 filter was requests at compression,
  7-zip used swap4 filter instead (but id was swap2), so archives were incorrect.
  
4.61           2008-11-23
-------------------------
- Bug in ver. 4.58+ was fixed:
   7-Zip didn't use any -m* switch after -mtc, -mcl or -mcu for .zip archives. 
- Bug in .CAB code was fixed. 7-Zip didn't show some empty files,
  if .CAB archive contains more than one empty file.
   

4.59           2008-07-27
-------------------------
- Bug was fixed:
   LZMA Encoder in fast compression mode could access memory outside of 
   allocated range in some rare cases.
   

4.59 alpha     2008-05-30
-------------------------
- BUGS was fixed: 
    7zOut.cpp: 7-Zip incorrectly wrote size of property records in some cases.
    7zIn.cpp:  7-Zip incorrectly work with archive, containg archive properties.

4.58 alpha 9   2008-04-29
-------------------------
- BUG was fixed: 7-Zip showed incorrect timestamps in ISO files.


4.58 alpha 8   2008-04-15
-------------------------
- BUG in 4.58 alpha 5/6/7 was fixed:
    LZMA encoder worked incorrectly, if lp != 0.
- Unicode (UTF-8) support for filenames in .ZIP archives. Now there are 3 modes:
    1) Default mode: 7-Zip uses UTF-8, if the local code page doesn't contain required symbols.
    2) -mcu switch:  7-Zip uses UTF-8, if there are non-ASCII symbols.
    3) -mcl switch:  7-Zip uses local code page.
- Now it's possible to use -mSW- and -mSW+ switches instead of -mSW=off and -mSW=on  


4.58 alpha 7   2008-04-08
-------------------------
- BUG was fixed: BZip2Encoder and BZip2Decoder used CEvent objects without 
  creating, when BZip2 code was called with one thread (with -mmt1 switch or with 
  default switches on single thread CPU).
- .lzma support.
- RPM and NSIS support was improved.
- LZMA now stores only (2 << n) or (3 << n) dictionary size value to LZMA properties.


4.58 alpha 6   2008-03-27
-------------------------
- NTFS time extra in ZIP.
- New item property - kpidTimeType - VT_UI4 (0 - NTFS, 1 - Unix, 2 - DOS).
- Static CRC table is not required now for Lzma Encoder (in Lz MatchFinder).


4.58 alpha 5   2008-03-19
-------------------------
- Creation time (-mtc switch) for .7z archives
- LZMA encoder was converted to ANSI-C


4.58 alpha 3   2008-02-25
-------------------------
- Speed optimizations for LZMA decoding. Now it uses C code instead of C++.
- 7-Zip now has 128 MB dictionary limit for 32-bit version:
  It's for speed optimization: kNumLogBits = 9 + sizeof(size_t) / 2;
- TAR: 'D' link flag support.
- 7-Zip now can unpack multivolume RAR archives created with 
  "old style volume names" scheme (-vn switch) and names *.001, *.002, ...
- Fixed bugs:
  - 7-Zip FM could not copy / move files to root network folders like \\COMPNAME\FOLDERNAME\
    In case of move it removed original files.
  - SFX-WIN: if there are errors, it still could return 0.
  - ZIP (.XPS file) isZip64 && thisDiskNumber16 == 0xFFFF.
  - ZIP name updating:
      If zip file contains extra field and you try to change properties of files,
      7-zip tries to delete all extra fileds (except for WzAES).
      And that code could hang.
  -  7-Zip GUI didn't suggest BZip2 dictionary size used in previous run.
  -  If creation time stamp was included in .RAR archive, 7-zip used creation time stamp 
     as modification time stamp.

4.58 alpha 2   2007-12-31
-------------------------
- Small changes in Deflate and LZMA compression.
- Some speed optimizations.

- Open error messages
- unRar 1.5 fixed

  fixed version:
    data = _matchFinder.GetPointerToCurrentPos(_matchFinderObj) - 1;
  It could lead to very small cpmpression ratio decreasing when block needs move.
